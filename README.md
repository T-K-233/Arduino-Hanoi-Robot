## So what is Tower of Hanoi?

>The **Tower of Hanoi** (also called the **Tower of Brahma** or **Lucas' Tower**) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a [conical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone) shape.

>The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
>
>1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
>2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
>3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

>With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2*n* − 1, where *n* is the number of disks
